## 🎯 Objective

My goal is to become a **digital investigator**—someone capable of identifying, analyzing, and solving security threats. I’m especially interested in working in a **Security Operations Center (SOC)**, as a **forensic analyst**, or in **threat hunting**, combining investigation and technical skills.
